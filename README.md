# One Dark Pro for RStudio
![](img/rstudio-onedark.png)

A 'Total IDE' build of the One Dark Pro theme for RStudio!

To install this theme, download the `OneDarkPro.rstheme` file from this repository, or [via Googe Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hYeQcG4g80kjz64EiQIeJyT1sd741WEt/view?usp=sharing). Then in RStudio go to Global Options -> Appearance, and click the `Add...` button under Editor Theme. Navigate to the `OneDarkPro.rstheme` file, hit `Open` and you're good to go.

This theme was adapted from [this theme](https://github.com/patrickshox/Mojave-Dark-RStudio-Theme), much thanks to Patrick for working out how to change more than just the code editor in RStudio!

Note: There can be versioning issues with some of the various UI components (different item codes etc). This theme has been tested and is fully functional on:
```
macOS Catalina 10.15.6, RStudio 1.4.750
```
and
```
Windows 10, RStudio 1.2.5033
```

The editor font I use is [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode), and the majority of the UI font is [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans). It is not necessary to install these.

If you have any suggested improvements, let me know!
